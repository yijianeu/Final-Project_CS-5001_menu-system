# Final-Project_CS-5001_menu-system
This is a menu system for helping people to create a daily menu



## Project Ideas
What are some ideas for your project? Why does that interest you?

I am thinking about the menu information system, and I think this system will be quiet interesting because I will think about what to eat everyday, which is the super basic but important things for human daily life. However, I may still struggle about what I may want to eat everyday. So, the menu system will help human to think about what to eat, and it is just like the guide map with as much information as possible, like what kind of meat you preferred, what kind of cooking style that you like, and what kind of favor that you want, even the how much calories that recommend for each day.

## What are the big ideas?
How does this address some of the big learning ideas of 5001?

I believe my project will involve working with Python code related to strings, while loops, and some basic functions, similar to the tasks we handled in the midterm.

## Code Design Thoughts
Are you including classes or APIs, what about dictionaries? One of the worst things you can do is go into a project assuming you are going to 'hard' code everything (this happens often with text based games, then students get stuck). You don't have to know details yet, but you should think about separation of concerns, and how to divide up your code. 

•	Avoiding Hard Coding
•	Trying to separate the big project into different small parts.
•	This is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.

## Resources Found
What are some resources you have found already or already have access to? (APIs, libraries, past assignments, etc)

I know a website about the food menu. It likes the system that I want to create, and I can try to follow the website as the template to create my own system. https://cook.yunyoujun.cn/

## Timeline
Setup a general timeline that includes research and development, and when you want to have certain aspects of the project done.

Week 1 is dedicated to research, where you'll identify the necessary resources, set clear objectives, and outline your project's requirements. In Week 2, you'll begin development, starting with the core functionalities. This phase continues into Week 3, allowing for the refinement of these features and possibly starting on secondary functionalities. Reserve Week 4 for final development touches, thorough testing, and preparing documentation.
