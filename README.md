## Description 
Creating a menu system to help decide daily meals is a practical and valuable tool. It would consider personal preferences, dietary restrictions, and nutritional goals to suggest meal options. This system could alleviate the daily stress of meal decision-making by offering tailored suggestions based on a set of criteria, including:

* Preferred types of meat or protein sources.
* Desired cooking styles (grilled, baked, steamed, etc.).
* Flavor preferences (spicy, savory, sweet, etc.).
* Caloric intake based on individual dietary needs.



## Key Features
* The system asks the user a series of questions concerning their preferences for different food categories, such as type of meat, cooking method, flavor profile, and number of calories. This enables the provision of a highly personalized meal plan that accommodates the dietary needs and preferences of every individual.
* The 'get_user_preference' function allows the system to have a conversational interaction with the user by requesting their preferences and verifying the accuracy of their selections. User engagement is increased by this interaction, which resembles a casual conversation.
* The system is easy to use even for non-techies, as it provides clear prompts and straightforward instructions.
* The script is very flexible to accommodate a variety of cuisines and changing dietary trends because it uses predefined data sets (food_preferences and dishes_data), which make it easy to add new food categories or dishes to the system.

## Guide
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the user would interact with the system:

* Welcome Menu: When the system starts, it greets the user with a welcome message, inviting them to interact with the menu system.
* Guided Choices: The user is guided through a series of choices. Each step narrows down the options, making it easy for the user to make decisions without feeling overwhelmed.
* Sequential Selection:
Menu: The user starts by indicating they want a meal suggestion by typing 'menu'.
* Meat: The system then prompts the user to select their preferred type of meat from the available options.
* Cooking: Next, the user chooses their desired cooking style, further customizing the meal to their liking.
* Flavor: The user selects their preferred flavor profile, adding another layer of personalization.
* Calories: Finally, the user chooses a calorie range, allowing them to align the meal with their dietary goals.


## Installation Instructions
If we wanted to run this project locally, what would we need to do?  If we need to get API key's include that information, and also command line startup commands to execute the project. If you have a lot of dependencies, you can also include a requirements.txt file, but make sure to include that we need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or something similar.

## Code Review
Go over key aspects of code in this section. Both link to the file, include snippets in this report (make sure to use the [coding blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)).  Grading wise, we are looking for that you understand your code and what you did. 

### Major Challenges
Key aspects could include pieces that your struggled on and/or pieces that you are proud of and want to show off.


## Example Runs
Explain how you documented running the project, and what we need to look for in your repository (text output from the project, small videos, links to videos on youtube of you running it, etc)

## Testing
How did you test your code? What did you do to make sure your code was correct? If you wrote unit tests, you can link to them here. If you did run tests, make sure you document them as text files, and include them in your submission.

## Missing Features / What's Next
The system could be designed to learn from past choices to better tailor future meal suggestions, making it an adaptive tool for meal planning. It would also be beneficial if the system could incorporate a grocery list feature to ensure all ingredients for the selected meals are noted, making shopping more efficient. Such a system's implementation could range from a simple app to a more complex AI-driven platform that could integrate with smart kitchen appliances for a seamless culinary experience. It would be a modern solution to the timeless question of "What should I eat today?

## Final Reflection
Write at least a paragraph about your experience in this course. What did you learn? What do you need to do to learn more? Key takeaways? etc.
